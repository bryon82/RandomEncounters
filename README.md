Generates encounters while you are out at sea. You must be roughly 10 miles away from land to get a chance at an encounter.

* Generates whales from the fantastic mod [SeaLifeMod](https://github.com/BryanP-JP19/SailwindSeaLifeMod) by Discord user BryanPhillips, if it is installed, at a more random cadence. Medium chance for this encounter. <details><summary>click to view chance percent</summary>30%</details>
